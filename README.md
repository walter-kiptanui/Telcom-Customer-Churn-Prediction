This project is about analysis of customers of a certain telcom company. The dataset was obtained from kaggle.

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers cease their relationship with a company or service. In other words, it's the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service within a given time period.

Churn is a crucial metric for businesses, particularly in subscription-based models or industries with recurring revenue, such as telecommunications, internet services, software as a service (SaaS), and subscription boxes. Understanding and managing customer churn is essential for maintaining and growing a customer base, as acquiring new customers can be more expensive than retaining existing ones.
The main objective of this project is:

  i. To understand the reasons behind the customers churning.

The specific objectives are:

  i. To predict the probability of new customers churning
  ii. To suggest ways of retaining customers and meeting their needs.
